# cheatR: Catch 'em baddies <img src="doc\cheatRball.png" align="right" height="345" width="300"/>

This is a mini package to help you find cheaters by comparing hand-ins.

## Download and Install

You can install `cheatR` from [github](https://github.com/mattansb/cheatR) with:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mattansb/cheatR")
```

## Example use

Create a list of files:

```{r}
my_files <- list.files(path = 'doc', pattern = '.doc', full.names = T)
my_files
```
The first 3 files are different drafts of the same paper, so we would expect them to be similar to each other, and the last is a draft of a different paper, so it should be dissimilar to the first 3.

Then use `cheatR` to fix duplicates.

```{r}
library(cheatR)
results <- catch_em(flist = my_files,
                    n_grams = 10, time_lim = 1) # defults
```

The input values are:  
  
  - `flist` - a list of documents (`.doc`/`.docx`/`.pdf`)
  - `n_grams` - see [`ngram` package](https://github.com/wrathematics/ngram).
  - `time_lim` - max time in seconds for each comparison (we found that some corrupt files run forever and crash R, so a time limit might be needed).
  
The resulting list contains a matrix with the similarity values between each pair of documents:

```{r}
knitr::kable(results$results)
```
