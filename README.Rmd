# cheatR: Catch 'em baddies <img src="doc\cheatRball.png" align="right" height="345" width="300"/>

This is a mini package to help you find cheaters by comparing hand-ins!  
([Read more](https://mattansb.blogspot.com/2018/07/cheatr-r-package-for-catching-cheaters.html) about the circumstances that brought about the development of this package.)

## Download and Install

You can install `cheatR` from [github](https://github.com/mattansb/cheatR) with:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mattansb/cheatR")
```

## Example usage

<!-- generated from the vignette. Please see that file -->

```{r child = 'vignettes/using-cheatR.Rmd'}
```

### Shiny app!

The accompanying `Shiny` app can be found on [shinyapps.io](https://almogsi.shinyapps.io/cheatR/), but can also be run locally with:

```R
cheatR::catch_em_app()
```

## Limitations?
  
  - As far as we can tell, this should work on any language; we tried both English and Hebrew, with and without setting `Sys.setlocale("LC_ALL", "Hebrew")`.  
  - Best performance was achieved on `R` version > 3.5.0.
