# cheatR: Catch 'em baddies <img src="doc\cheatRball.png" align="right" height="345" width="300"/>

This is a mini package to help you find cheaters by comparing hand-ins!

## Download and Install

You can install `cheatR` from [github](https://github.com/mattansb/cheatR) with:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mattansb/cheatR")
```

## Example use

### In R console

Create a list of files:

```{r}
my_files <- list.files(path = 'doc', pattern = '.doc', full.names = T)
my_files
```
The first 3 documents are different drafts of the same paper, so we would expect them to be similar to each other. The last document is a draft of a different paper, so it should be dissimilar to the first 3. **All files are about 45K words long.**

Now we can use `cheatR` to find duplicates.  

The only function, `catch_em`, takes the following input arguments:  
  
  - `flist` - a list of documents (`.doc`/`.docx`/`.pdf`). A full/relative path must be provided.
  - `n_grams` - see [`ngram` package](https://github.com/wrathematics/ngram).
  - `time_lim` - max time in seconds for each comparison (we found that some corrupt files run forever and crash R, so a time limit might be needed).

```{r}
library(cheatR)
results <- catch_em(flist = my_files,
                    n_grams = 10, time_lim = 1) # defults
```

The resulting list contains a matrix with the similarity values between each pair of documents:

```{r}
knitr::kable(results$results)
```

You can also plot the relational graph if you'd like to get a more clear picture of who copied from who.

```{r cheater_graph, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidygraph)
library(ggraph)

results_graph <- as_tbl_graph(results$results) %>% 
  activate(what = edges) %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight))

ggraph(results_graph) +
  geom_edge_fan(aes(label = round(weight,2)),
                 angle_calc = 'along',
                label_dodge = unit(2.5, 'mm')) +
  geom_node_label(aes(label = name))

```

### Shiny app!

The accompanying `Shiny` app can be found on [shinyapps.io](https://almogsi.shinyapps.io/cheatR/), but can also be run locally with:

```R
cheatR::catch_em_app()
```

## Limitations?
  
  - As far as we can tell, this should work on any language; we tried both English and Hebrew, with and without setting `Sys.setlocale("LC_ALL", "Hebrew")`.  
  - Best performance was achieved on `R` version > 3.5.0.
